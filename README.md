# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon Alexa product reviews. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building using machine learning algorithms.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Amazon Alexa reviews, which is stored in a tab-separated values (TSV) file. The dataset contains the following columns:

rating: The rating given by the user.
date: The date of the review.
variation: The variation of the Alexa product.
verified_reviews: The actual review text.
feedback: Whether the review is positive (1) or negative (0).
Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

Alexa-amazon-reviews.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis, from data loading to model evaluation.
amazon_alexa.tsv: The dataset used in this analysis.
# Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have the following libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib nltk scikit-learn wordcloud
Usage
Clone the repository.
Run the Jupyter notebook 7. Alexa-amazon-reviews.ipynb to reproduce the analysis.
Example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('amazon_alexa.tsv', delimiter='\t')

# Preprocess and analyze data using the notebook
# Results
The project performs sentiment analysis to classify reviews as positive or negative. The analysis includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing using regular expressions and NLTK.
Feature extraction using CountVectorizer.
Model training and evaluation using a Random Forest Classifier.
